Hi, there!

My works:
- low-level packet capture modules written in C,
- Eclipse RCP-based desktop modules,
- backend services built with Spring,
- and designing software architectures for enterprise solutions.

I have experience collaborating with overseas developers
and enjoy working on complex systems where performance,
reliability, and correctness matter.
